I took my troubles down to Madame Rue.
You know that gypsy with the gold capped tooth
She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine,
Selling little bottles of Love Potion #9.
I told her that I was a flop with chicks.
I've been disgraced since 1956.
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign.
She said what you need is Love Potion #9.
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink.
It smelled like turpentine, and looked like Indian ink.
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink!
I didn't know if it was day or night.
I started kissing everything in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine.
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion #9.
(instrumental)

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa  hey Jude...  (repeat X number of times)


When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a Valentine,birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three,would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?Hmm------mmm---mmmh.
You'll be older, too.Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wightif it's not to dear. We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?by John Lennon/Paul McCartney

I look at all the lonely people.
I look at all the lonely people.Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where her wedding has been;
Lives in a dream.
Waits at the window,
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door.
Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?Father MacKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear;
No one comes near.
Look at him working,
Nodding his socks in the night when there's nobody there.
What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?I look at all the lonely people.
I look at all the lonely people.Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried alone with her name.
Nobody came.
Father MacKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from her grave.
No one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?


Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass awaySunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this greyAll things must pass
All things must pass awayAll things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another dayNow the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this greyAll things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away

He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
He had a pair of ol' wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashing 5 below
It was freezing rain and spitting snow
he was curled up behind some garbage cans
i was afraid that he was dead
i gave him a gentle shake
when he opened up his eyes
i said ol' man are you ok?... he said...I just climed out of a cotton wood tree
i was running from some honey bees
drip drying in the summer breeze
after jumping  in the calacoe creek
i was walking down an old dirt road
passed a field of hay that had just been mowed
man i wish you'd just left me alone
cuz i was almost homeand he said i had just coming round the barn
bout time you grabbed my arm
when i heard momma holla
son hurry up
i was close enough from my own nose
to smell fresh cogger on the stove
and i saw daddy loadin' up the truck
game polls on the tail gate
bobbers blowing in the wind
Since July of '55
that's as close as I've been...(chorus)I said ol' man you're gonna freeze to death
let me drive you to the mission
he said, "Boy if you'd left me alone
right now I'd be fishing...(Chorus)

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever hadI can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more miseryAsk me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of youI love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know

And I'm always thinking of youI can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more miseryAsk me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourselfBuys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourselfGoing tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself


If you ever leave me, I'll be sadand blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely,
If they knew that I lost my one and only,
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying,
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go,
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely,
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go,
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely,
"Cos they know I got my one and only
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me,
They'd be glas that you're not bad to me, to me, to me

There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the breath of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long for I may be asleep
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long


You can knock me down,
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do,
But oh oh honey,
Lay of them blue suede shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes
Ah go!
You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor
From a old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do,
But ah ah honey,
Lay of them blue suede shoes
And don't you step
On my blue suede shoes, please
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes
Ah go, hit it, Carl (Perkins)!
Well blue blue,
Blue suede shoes
Yeah blue blue,
Blue Suede shoes
Blue blue blue,
Blue suede shoes
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes

*Chorus x 2: Hey Bungalo Bill what did you kill bungalobill)
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
Incase of accidents he'd always take his mom
Who's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son.
(All the children sing)
*CHORUS
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lyes
Bill and his elephants where taken by suprise
So captain marvel zaped him right between th eyes
(All the children sing)
*CHORUS
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not since he looked so fierce his mother buted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
(All the children sing)
*CHORUS x 7 (whistling fades in as chorus begins to fade out)

On the road to Marrakesh
I was dreaming more or less,
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was trueI'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's childrenSunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to homeI'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's childrenUnderneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soulI'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children


Wait
Oh yes, merry Christmas little girl
Hey!
Last year, you left me, little girl...Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone specialOnce bitten and twice as shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise meLast christmas,
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me againLast Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh yeah)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone specialA crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry onA face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh, Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me againLast Christmas (twice as shy)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (you still catch my eye)
This year
To save me from tears (do you recognize me?)
I'll give it to someone special (no, it doesn't surprise me)Last Christmas (I wrapped it up and sent it)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (saying "I love you" I meant it)
This year (what a fool i've been)
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (I know you'll fool me again)Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh yeah)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special)Last Christmas (oh yeah)

Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see not future
Can't see no sky
My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm at the deep freeze
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying for someone
Free me again
Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run
