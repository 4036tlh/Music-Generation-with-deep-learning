He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall

See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go onHe said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

I stole a key,
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet,
I took a car downtown and took what they offered me.
To set me free,
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene,
I saw the lights go down and they're standing in front of me.
My scarecrow dreams,
When they smashed my heart into smithereens,
I be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete.
Be the cartoon heart,
Light a fire, light a spark,
Light a fire, a flame in my heart.
We'll run wild,
We'll be glow-in-the-dark.
All the boys, all the girls,
All the mess in the world
All the boys, all the girls,
All the mess that occurs.
All the high's, all the low's,
We'll run wild,
We'll start glowing-in-the-dark.
So we'll run wild,
We'll be glow-in-the-dark.

Shoot an apple off my head

Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
DaylightSlowly breaking through the daylight (x22 to fade)

Coldplay-Gold In Them Hills
I know it doesn't seem that way
But maybe it's the perfect day
Even though the bills are piling
And maybe Lady Luck ain't smilingBut if we'd only open our eyes
We'd see the blessings in disguise
That all the rain clouds are fountains
Though our troubles seem like mountainsThere's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to startEvery now and then life says
Where do you think you're going so fast
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes
It's a case of cruel to be kindAnd if we'd get up off our knees
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees
And we'd see the new sun rising
Over the hills on the horizonThere's gold in them hills
There's gold in them hills
So don't lose faith
Give the world a chance to say...A word or two, my friend
There's no telling how the day might end
And we'll never know until we see
That there's gold in them hillsThere's gold in them hills
So don't lose heart
Give the day a chance to startThere's gold in them hills...
There's gold in them hills...

Without youGreen eyesHoney you are the sea

Once moreThrough the years, we all have been together
If the saints allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"Here I am
and beyond the reach of my hands
she's sound asleep
and she's sweeter now than the wildest dreams
could have seen her
and have watched her slippin' awayand I know i'll be huntin' high and low
High
there's no end to the lenghts I'll go to
High and low
High
There's no end to the lenghts I'll go toFind her Again
upon this my dreams I depend in
through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could findSo I know I'll be huntin' high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
Do you know how it feels to love you?
Do you know how it feels to love you?
High and low"

'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so coldWritten up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so coldSee the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart
Fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let goYou
Ooohooh'Cause you doOh you, use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heavenOn every street, every car, every surface are names
And at the streets arise, i'll be rather insane
Don't let them take control
No we won't let take controlYes, I feel a little bit nervous,
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax,
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?So on concrete canvas under cover of dark
Concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I'll be armed with a spray can soulYou
OoohoohOh, you
OoohoohYes, you
You use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heavenWoho-ooh
Woho-ooohIt's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
It hurts like heaven


Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time.
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine.
Where do you go to, pretty baby?
Where do you go to, when the night wins away.
Ask me so sweetly, what do i do?
Who do I sing for?
Well honey I sing about you.
You.


One, two, three... wellI ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from youI'm gonna come on in
And see it throughI ran away from you
That's all I ever doAnd when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach toEveryone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to doI have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from youI'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closedI can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the skyA star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cageJust a single star
I sing forEveryone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to doI have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you


So I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent
I said yes I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it
And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot
Like an idiot?
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I was an idiot
I fell down like a goddamn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot
Like an idiot?
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
Listen now, it's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive? 





I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe inMay God’s love be with you
Always
May God’s love be with youI know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
’Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can’t keep awakeMay God’s love be with you
Always
May God’s love be with you’Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You
You
I'll find you
YouI don’t know anymore
What it’s for
I’m not even sure
If there is anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
’Cause I been caught in between all you wish for and all you need
Maybe you’re not even sure what it’s for
Any more than meMay God’s love be with you
Always
May God’s love be with you
Always
Always
May God's love be with you’Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You
You
I'll find you
You
Oh I will find you
You
Oh I'll find you
You

She's gone
two thousand miles
It's very farThe snow came down
Gets colder day by day
I miss herI hear children saying,
"It felt like christmas time"In these frozen and silent nights
Sometime in a dream,
You appearOutside, under the purple sky,
Diamonds in the snow
SparkleAnd our hearts were singing,
"It felt like Christmas time"2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
two thousand miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you goShe's gone
two thousand miles
It's very farThe snow came falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss youI hear people singing,
"It felt like Christmas time"
I heard people singing,
"It felt like Christmas time"
I heard people singing,
"It felt like Christmas time"
I hear people singing,
"It felt like Christmas time"

Now I never meant,
To do you wrong,
That's what I came here to say.But if I was wrong,
Then I'm sorry,
I don't let it stand in our way.As my head just aches,
When I think of,
The things that I shouldn't have done.But, life is for living,
We all know,
And I don't wanna live it alone.Sing,
Ah, ah, oh,
Sing
Ah, ah, oh,
And just think,
Ah, ah, oh.

She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlightShe'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give youLips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kissesShe knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
To melt into this lakeShe'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kissesShe'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
She knows what I'm thinkingShe'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give youLips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses


maybe, I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
Coz I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks it to the boneand maybe I just wanna fly
wanna live , I don't wanna die
maybe I just wanna breathe
maybe I just don't believe
maybe you're the same as me
we see things they'll never see
you and I are gonna live foreverI said maybe I don't really wanna know
how your garden grows
coz I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks it to the boneand maybe I will never be
all the things that I'd like to be
now is not the time to cry
nows the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me

I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I past by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highwayJust a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
On the day we met, oh I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highwayI was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highwayNow boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
You started rollin' down that lost highway
