Is this the real life, is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes , look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
...to meMama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama oooh... Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really mattersToo late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama oooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at allI see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo figaro (Magnifico)
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for meSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of hereNothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows....

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)

It swings (woooh woooh), It jives (woooh woooh)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, I kind of like it
Crazy little thing called loveThere goes my baby, she knows how to Rock'n'Roll
She drives my crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

Get on my track's, take a back seat
Hitch hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready, crazy little thing called loveI gotta be cool relax get hip!

Crazy little thing called love...


She keeps Moet and Chandon in her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
And anytime an invitation you can decline
Caviar and cigarettes well versed in etiquette
Extr'ordinarily niceShe's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine, dynamite with a lazer beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind... (anytime)
Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less, fastidious and preciseShe's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)Drop of a hat she's as willing as a playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you
She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine
dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)


In the year of thirty-nine' assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.
and the night followed day, and the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never criedDon't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you, write your letters in the sand
For the day I'll take your hand, in the land that our grand-children knewIn the year of thirty-nine', came a ship from the blue
The volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born, though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be...
Oh so many years have gone, though I'm older than a year
Your mothers eyes from your eyes cry to meDon't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand, for the day I'll take your hand
In the land that our grand-children knewDon't you hear my call, though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you, all your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand, for my life still ahead... pity me

It's Winter-fall, Red skies are gleaming, oh
Sea-gulls are flying over, Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney-tops, am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?
The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing, Grown-ups are standing by
What a super feeling, am I dreaming
Am I dreaming?
Wo, wo, wo, wo(dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(dreaming) What a truly magnificient view
(dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world in the palm of your hand(dreaming) A cosy fireside chat
(dreaming) A little this, a little that
(dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skipping by
(dreaming) Gentle rain beating on my face
(dreaming) What an extraordinary place!And the dream of the child is the hope -of the hope- of the man
It's all so beautiful, like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zooming higher, mmm
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning, and spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable, sends me reeling
Am I dreaming, Am I dreaming
Oooh it's bliss


This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heart beat pulse, That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling this world is using meThis town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let down
Coming to this town honey is a show down
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray
Through a crack in the shutter
Or a sight of a light, at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling this world is using meAction this day, action this night
Oh we've gotta learn, to love, to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't rightYour mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heart beat pulse, That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit
This world is using meAction this day, action this night
Oh we've gotta learn, to love, to live
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day, action this night
Oh you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love, to live
You can't say it ain't rightAction, action this day, action this day
Action, action this day, action this day
Living in the street...
Action...


She came without a farthing, a babe without a name
So much ado about nothing, is what she's try to say
So much ado my lover,
so many games we played
Through every fleeted summer, through every precious dayAll dead, all dead, all the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead, and alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead, All dead, and gone, all deadAll dead, all dead, at the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead, Take me back again
You know my little friend's, all dead and goneHer ways are always with me, I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me, I am old but still a childAll dead, all dead, but I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone, all dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe, of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone, all dead and gone


So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers (yeah) and majesty around the world
Open your eyes look touch and feel

Don't slam the door, on your way out
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
Another long distance night alone,
you leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more.
Last word today, coming home to stay?
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.
It's just another rainy night, without you.Listen, there's a foghorn blowing
from the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain.
I'm not much without you, can't leave
if I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay aroundBut tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour.
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called.I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.I know I've said it before
hate the sound of the closing door
and your footsteps walking away.(solo)But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.v
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
And it's another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.It's just another rainy night, another rainy night,
another rainy night without you.

It's a Machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for you and me.They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away

Far, far from the light
Here the night creatures call
In the cold breath they howl
And the hollow tears, they're calling youI'll be there, though maybe you wont see my babe
I'll still care, no mater where I'll still be there
When you make to the other sideLord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soulDeep, deep in the night
When the world fils with tears
And the wind grows, colder and colder it grows
And the fire dimes, with the same old fearsI'll be there, no matter what you're going through
In the dark I care, I'm holding on, I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside#Lord I'm going back, back to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soulOn and on, searching for the clearer view
Winning and loosing an inner war
Wondering what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending throughNo matter where you're going to
I'll be there
I'm holding on, believe it
We'll be walking in the light
?cos there'll be no place left to hideBack to the light
Back to the dreams that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land, where the sunshine heals my soul
Let me hear you babes - yeah, yeah, yeah


I had this perfect dream
Un sueño me envolvio
This dream was me and you
Tal vez estas aqui
I want all the world to see
Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming trueThe wind is a gentle breeze
El me hablo de ti
The bells are ringing out
El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go awayBarcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibro
Barcelona - Y ella nos unio
And if God willing we will meet again somedayLet the songs begin
Dejalo nacer
Let the music play
Ahhhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
Van a mi
And cry
Grita
Come alive
Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ahhh ,Ahhh, Shaking all our livesBarcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campamas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end

(berry/buck/mills/stipe)All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dared to take a chance
Goin' home aloneBut it gets so fucky cold
When it's late at nightLeave the foxholes on their own
Do you sleep well at night?Body count, feeling hot
Body count, keeping warmFriends are playing with danger
They don't know where it's found
With their casual letters
It's just another chainYou've lost the innocence
That you've never found
Standing in the dmz
Don't get turned around(chorus)
Body count, feeling hot
Body count, vietnamIt's not the game, it's a scar
And they won't let you wear your khakis
And your izods anymoreYou can go get shot to hell
They don't want you anymore becauseAll the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dare to take a chance
You're going home alone
Military metaphors
Are metaphors no moreKeeping up with protocol
You're dancin? off to war(repeat chorus)Do you sleep well at night?Body count, vietnamThey can say what they want
But you have your doubtsIt's not what you've lost
It's what your withoutWhen I ran so far
And they just turned awayI doesn't bother me by the light of day
But at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your callI saw the mirror that you broke today
I saw the ceiling falling down your wayWhen they looked at you, you could turn away
You didn't bother then by the light of day, you'll stayBut at night, I hear your call
Late at night, I hear your callYou said that you could turn away
I knew that you going to stayThe walls are falling all around
They pinned you down onto the ground
But at night, I hear your call
Vietnam, I hear you call


Give me, body, give me, body, body
Give me, your body

Is this the real life, is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes , look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
...to meMama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama oooh... Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really mattersToo late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama oooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at allI see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo figaro (Magnifico)
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for meSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of hereNothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows....

Your smile
Speaks books to me

Happy little day Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"-"Jenny will you stay tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love what do you say?"-
-"Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"-Oh rock of ages do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh lady moon shine down, a little people magic if you willJenny pines away writes a letter every day
-"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"-
-"Oh no I'm compromised
I must apologize if my lady should discover how I spent my holidays"-

You suck my blood like a leech, you break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts, you've taken all my money
And you want more...
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules
With your narrow minded cronies, who are fools of the first divisionDeath on two legs, you're tearing me apart
Death on two legs, you've never had a heart of your ownKill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
have you found a new toy to replace me? Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbyeFeel good, are you satisfied? Do you feel like, suicide?(I think you should)
Is your conscience all right Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good feel good?You talk like a big business tycoon, you're just a hot air balloon
So no-one gives you a damn, you're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease, you're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is, mister know-all
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? (Shark)Death on two legs, you're tearing me apart
Death on two legs, You've never had a heart (you never did)
of your own (Right from the start)
Insane you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed, then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good I feel good

You'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true - yeah
Everything I do is driven by youOh - come on babe
Oh well it's tough to make a journey through
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me
And you know we've still got time

It's the sad eyed goodbye Yesterday's moments I remember
It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mists the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at allIt's the fantastic drowse, of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears, the unending pleadings
To waste all your good times, In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero, and there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young, and your troubles are all very smallOut here on the street we'd gather and meet, and scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet, half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall, than we did in the school hallWith the down town chewing gum bums
watching the night life the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door, always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy, It ain't easy at all
Thinking it right and doing it wrong, It's easier from an arm chair
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood, Jimi Hendrix he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror, now who else do I like?


Are you gonna take me home tonight
Ah down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rocking world go round
Hey I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me, Hey hey!I've been singing with my band, across the wire across the land
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style, went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every timeOh won't you take me home tonight? Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Hey listen hereNow your mortgages and homes, I got stiffness in the bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
Oh but I still get my pleasure, still got my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me
Now get this...
Oh you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh down beside your red firelight, Oh you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Get on your bikes and rideOooh yeah them fat bottomed girls
Fat bottomed girls, Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fat bottomed girls, Yes, yes
