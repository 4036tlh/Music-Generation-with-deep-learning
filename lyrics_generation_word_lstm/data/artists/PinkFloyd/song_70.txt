Oh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high! Don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another oneOoh don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frailOoh don't talk to me
Please, just walk with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frailIt's true sun's shining very bright
It's you I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soonOoh don't talk to me
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frailOh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another one
