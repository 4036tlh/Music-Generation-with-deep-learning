Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
What'll be to crunch in your sisters
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all foursScream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Flack chap chau fauses, mouses, houses
Flittin and hittin and fittin quack quackWatching the teley till all hours big time
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughterScream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
What'll be coming to crunch in your sisters
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all foursScream thy last scream old woman with a casket
