Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......Oooh, don't talk to me
Please just fuck with me
Please you know I'm feeling frailIt's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soonOooh, don't touch me child
Please you know you drive me wild
Please you know I'm feeling frailDon't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very very very frailOh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......
